Attention is a way of focusing on certain parts of a sequence of data, such as words in a sentence, to better understand the context of the data. Transformers use a series of layers of attention to process data. Each layer looks at the data from a different perspective, allowing the model to better understand the data. The layers are connected to each other, allowing the model to learn from the data as it passes through the layers. The model then uses this information to make predictions or decisions.'"
